                <p>Fun is Lucia's middle name! (actually it's Marie) She's a natural on water as much as she is on land and loves the trill of fast turbulent rapids. Don’t let her fool you, this girl’s got arms of steel, she can handle anything that’s thrown at her. She hugged me once and I felt safe. Sam taught swimming lessons and was a life guard for about five years before becoming a guide for whitewater rafting.</p>

                <p>Matias has been swimming in the water longer than he could walk. He's spent years whitewater rafting as far as the Rhein, Switzerland and Noce River, Italy. This tough guide can show you the smoothest routes on the river as well as maneuver though unruly rapids as if he were Poseidon himself. I mean look at him, that’s the angelic smile of someone you can trust.</p>
